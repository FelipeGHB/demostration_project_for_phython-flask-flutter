## About This Project
In this project, we will use Python to show what Flask and Flutter is, as well as their capacities and simple skills for both frameworks.

### Tools Needed
- [Phython](https://www.python.org)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- Powershell
- Anaconda3
- Command Prompt
- Visual Studio Code

## Flask
Jack will demonstrate how to download Flask and a basic overview of what it does.

### Tools Needed
- Anaconda3 (Python)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- Powershell
- Command Prompt
- Visual Studio Code

### Introduction
Flask is a micro web framework that is written in the Python programming language. It does not really require any tools or libraries, nor does it have any database components. It is referred to as a microframework that keeps the core "simple and also extensible".

### Installation
Open up PowerShell as Administrator
Install and update with (**Note:** If you already have Anaconda3 downloaded then you already have Flask downloaded):
```Powershell
pip install -U Flask
```
Create a virtual environment (flaskproject will be whatever you want to name you environment and python=your version):
```Powershell
conda create -n flaskproject python=3.8 anaconda
```

Open up the command prompt and activate your virtual environment:
```
conda activate flaskproject
```
<img src="Flask2.PNG" width="600" height="300"/>

Your virtual environment is now ready to go!
